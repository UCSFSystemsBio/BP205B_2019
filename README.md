# BP205B_2019
This course is designed to be a miniaturized grad school experience for computational or quantitative students. This is a project-based course. You will be handed new data generated specifically for this class, and you will get to experience what it takes to go all the way from raw data, to generation of hypotheses, to generation of rigorous results. Along the way you may experience excitement, confusion, frustration, and enlightenment – the full research cycle.

This year, our focus is on single cell genomics. As part of this class, we will study the population structure of cancer cells as they become more metastatic. While research is the primary focus of the course, there is plenty of opportunity for learning. In addition to frequent access to the instructors and our fantastic TAs, faculty whose research is primarily focused on or takes advantage of single cell genomics (both computational and/or experimental) are also invited to present every week. Journal clubs and reading assignments form the third pillar of this course. Our ultimate goal in this course is to teach you ‘how to fish,’ and we expect a high degree of involvement, maturity and leadership from the class itself. So, join us if you are ready to experience the full cycle of scientific challenge.
